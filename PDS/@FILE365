//***FILE 365 IS FROM RON MACRAE OF AMDAHL, UK.  THIS FILE CONTAINS *   FILE 365
//*           A SYSTEM TO AUTOMATICALLY PACKAGE ONE OR MORE MVS     *   FILE 365
//*           DATASETS FOR TRANSMISSION ACROSS THE INTERNET,        *   FILE 365
//*           WITH BUILT-IN ERROR DETECTION.  TSO XMIT IS USED      *   FILE 365
//*           UNDER THE COVERS, AND 8 ERROR CHECKING BYTES ARE      *   FILE 365
//*           APPENDED TO EACH 80-BYTE RECORD, SO THAT IF ANY BYTE  *   FILE 365
//*           IS ALTERED DURING THE TRANSMISSION, THE ERROR WILL    *   FILE 365
//*           BE CAUGHT.  YOU'RE GUARANTEED THE INTEGRITY OF YOUR   *   FILE 365
//*           TRANSMITTED FILES.  THE PACKAGE ALSO MAKES IT EASIER  *   FILE 365
//*           TO PACKAGE AND UNPACKAGE MULTIPLE FILES.  ONLY ONE    *   FILE 365
//*           BIG FILE IS ACTUALLY TRANSMITTED.  THE COMBINED FILE  *   FILE 365
//*           FOR TRANSMISSION IS VERY SIMPLE TO CREATE ON THE      *   FILE 365
//*           TRANSMITTING MVS SYSTEM, AND IT IS VERY SIMPLE TO     *   FILE 365
//*           UNWRAP ON THE RECEIVING MVS SYSTEM.  YOU DON'T HAVE   *   FILE 365
//*           TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME FOOLING WITH TSO XMIT COMMAND  *   FILE 365
//*           PARAMETERS.                                           *   FILE 365
//*                                                                 *   FILE 365
//*           THE IBM COMPRESSION UTILITY CALLED TRSMAIN, THAT IS   *   FILE 365
//*           DISTRIBUTED FOR FREE ON THE WEB, IS OPTIONALLY        *   FILE 365
//*           INTEGRATED WITH THIS PROCESS, PROVIDED TRSMAIN IS     *   FILE 365
//*           PRESENT.  IF THE FILES ARE LARGE, IT MAY PAY TO       *   FILE 365
//*           SEND THE MORE COMPRESSED VERSION ACROSS THE INTERNET. *   FILE 365
//*                                                                 *   FILE 365
//*           FILES PRODUCED BY THIS PACKAGE ARE SUFFIXED .XMT .    *   FILE 365
//*           COMPRESSED FILES PRODUCED BY TRSMAIN, ACTING AGAINST  *   FILE 365
//*           THE .XMT FILE, ARE SUFFIXED .XM1 .                    *   FILE 365
//*                                                                 *   FILE 365
//*           THE PACKAGE BASICALLY CONSISTS OF TWO REXX EXECS,     *   FILE 365
//*           AND OPTIONALLY AN ASSEMBLER PROGRAM.  THE EXEC        *   FILE 365
//*           CALLED OSTARXMT WILL PACKAGE ANY NUMBER OF FILES      *   FILE 365
//*           INTO TSO XMIT FORMAT, AND WILL BUNDLE ALL THE FILES   *   FILE 365
//*           TOGETHER, INTO ONE FILE THAT HAS THE BUILT-IN ERROR   *   FILE 365
//*           CHECKING.  OPTIONALLY, THE COMPRESSION UTILITY        *   FILE 365
//*           TRSMAIN WILL BE CALLED AFTERWARD, TO SQUEEZE THE      *   FILE 365
//*           FILE DOWN FURTHER.  IF THE ORIGINAL AMOUNT OF DATA    *   FILE 365
//*           IS LARGE, THIS HELPS.                                 *   FILE 365
//*                                                                 *   FILE 365
//*           THE OTHER EXEC, OSTARREC, WILL UNWRAP THE FILES       *   FILE 365
//*           CREATED BY OSTARXMT, CHECK TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE     *   FILE 365
//*           NO ERRORS, AND WILL CALL TSO RECEIVE FOR EACH OF THE  *   FILE 365
//*           INCLUDED FILES THAT WERE TRANSMITTED.  YOU'LL GET     *   FILE 365
//*           ALL THE FILES THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL      *   FILE 365
//*           BUNDLE.                                               *   FILE 365
//*                                                                 *   FILE 365
//*           OPTIONALLY, THE ASSEMBLER PROGRAM, IF ITS PRESENCE    *   FILE 365
//*           IS DETECTED BY THE REXX EXECS, WILL BE CALLED TO DO   *   FILE 365
//*           THE ERROR DETECTION LOGIC.  ALL OF THIS LOGIC IS      *   FILE 365
//*           ALSO BUILT INTO THE REXX EXECS, BUT IF THE ASSEMBLER  *   FILE 365
//*           PROGRAM IS CALLED, THE LOGIC IS EXECUTED FAR FASTER.  *   FILE 365
//*           THIS CAN MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IF LARGE       *   FILE 365
//*           AMOUNTS OF DATA ARE TO BE TRANSFERRED.  THE NAME OF   *   FILE 365
//*           THE ASSEMBLER PROGRAM IS OSTAREDC.                    *   FILE 365
